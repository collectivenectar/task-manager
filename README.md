# TUDU - Task Management Application

A modern task management application built with Next.js, Prisma, and TypeScript.

## Features
- ‚úÖ Full CRUD task management with drag-and-drop organization
- üîç Search and filter tasks by title, description, status, and category
- üì± Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- üöÄ Optimistic updates for smooth UX
- üë• Multi-user support via Clerk authentication
- üìÇ Category-based task organization

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14 with Server Actions
- TypeScript (end-to-end type safety)
- Prisma with PostgreSQL
- TanStack Query for state management
- Tailwind CSS
- Clerk Authentication
- Jest & React Testing Library
- Hello Pangea DnD (maintained fork of react-beautiful-dnd)
- Headless UI for accessible components
- Zod for runtime type validation

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables:   

```
   in .env:
   DATABASE_URL=your_db_url
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your openai api key

   in .env.local:
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_key
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret   
```
4. Run migrations: `npx prisma migrate dev`
5. Start development server: `npm run dev`

## Architecture
- Server Actions for API endpoints (eliminates need for separate API routes)
- React Query for client-state management and server-state caching
- Clerk for authentication and user management
- Prisma for type-safe database operations

## Security & Performance
- Server-side ownership verification on all operations
- Optimistic updates with error recovery
- Float-based positioning for efficient task reordering
- Ready for pagination/virtual scrolling

## Testing Coverage
- Unit tests for components and forms
- Integration tests for task management flows
- Mocked external services (Clerk, Prisma)
- Test utilities for common testing patterns

## Assumptions & Decisions
- Used Clerk over NextAuth for better TypeScript support
- Chose PostgreSQL for robust ordering capabilities
- Implemented categories as a required relationship
- Optimized for mobile-first development

## AI-Enhanced Task Management (WIP on 'smart-tasks' branch)

This feature branch explores the integration of AI to enhance task management workflows, focusing on helping users create more effective and actionable tasks.

### Current Implementation: SMART Task Assistant

The SMART Task Assistant helps users create better-defined tasks by:
- Converting vague task ideas into specific, measurable objectives
- Breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps
- Suggesting appropriate categories based on task context
- Providing clear success criteria for task completion

Key technical features:
- Server-side OpenAI integration with proper error handling
- Atomic batch task creation using Prisma transactions
- Real-time UI updates with optimistic rendering
- Contextual category suggestions based on existing user data

### Future Development Roadmap

1. **Enhanced Task Customization**
   - Inline editing of AI suggestions
   - Granular control over subtask creation
   - Custom success criteria definition

2. **Hierarchical Task Management**
   - Native subtask support with progress tracking
   - Task dependencies and workflows
   - Milestone tracking for complex projects

3. **AI-Driven Personal Optimization**
   - User behavior analysis for personalized suggestions
   - Completion rate optimization
   - Smart notifications based on productivity patterns
   - Task prioritization recommendations

### Technical Improvements Roadmap

1. **Backend Performance**
   - Add rate limiting for AI requests
   - Optimize database queries with proper indexing
   - Add request queue for batch operations
   - Implement background job processing for AI tasks

2. **Frontend Optimization**
   - Add client-side caching with SWR/React Query
   - Add progressive loading for task details
   - Implement service worker for offline support
   - Add debouncing for real-time updates

3. **Stability & Monitoring**
   - Implement automated testing for AI responses
   - Add fallback strategies for AI service outages

4. **Security Enhancements**
   - Add rate limiting per user
   - Implement input sanitization for AI prompts
   - Implement content filtering for AI responses

This implementation serves as a foundation for exploring how AI can enhance productivity tools by making them more intelligent and personalized while maintaining user agency and control.
